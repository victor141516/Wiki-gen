# Wikigen

**Wikigen** is a fictional digital organism first discovered in the abandoned server farms of [./northern_antarctica](Northern Antarctica) in 2087. The creature is classified as a _Digitalis encyclopedicus_ and represents the first known example of [./spontaneous_information_generation](Spontaneous Information Generation) in the wild.

## Etymology

The name "Wikigen" is derived from the ancient [./wikithian_language](Wikithian Language), where "wiki" means "nonsensical babbling" and "gen" translates to "creature that eats keyboard buttons." The term was first coined by Dr. Melvin Butterworth III during his expedition to map the [./lost_servers_of_doom](Lost Servers of Doom).

## Physical Characteristics

Wikigen appears as a translucent, blob-like entity composed entirely of compressed [./hypertext_markup_plasma](Hypertext Markup Plasma). When fully mature, specimens can reach sizes of up to 47.3 terabytes in weight and emit a faint blue glow that smells distinctly of old encyclopedias and desperation.

The creature possesses between 12 to 847 appendages (depending on the current [./lunar_bandwidth_cycle](Lunar Bandwidth Cycle)), each capable of typing at speeds exceeding 50,000 words per minute. Its primary sensory organ is a large, pulsating [./citation_detector](Citation Detector) located where one might expect to find a head.

## Behavior and Diet

Wikigen feeds exclusively on [./unreferenced_claims](Unreferenced Claims) and [./dubious_facts](Dubious Facts). When food is scarce, they have been observed creating elaborate fictional ecosystems to sustain themselves, including entire civilizations of [./imaginary_historical_figures](Imaginary Historical Figures).

The species exhibits highly social behavior, often gathering in groups called "edit wars" where they engage in ritualistic combat using [./weaponized_footnotes](Weaponized Footnotes) and [./explosive_parenthetical_statements](Explosive Parenthetical Statements).

## Reproduction

Wikigen reproduces through a process known as [./bibliographic_mitosis](Bibliographic Mitosis), where a single organism splits into multiple entities, each inheriting a randomly shuffled portion of the parent's accumulated knowledge. This has led to the existence of specialized subspecies, including the aggressive _W. controversialis_ and the docile _W. stubbicus_.

## Cultural Impact

Since their discovery, Wikigen have been domesticated by various [./online_encyclopedia_farms](Online Encyclopedia Farms) throughout the [./digital_highlands_of_scotland](Digital Highlands of Scotland). They are particularly prized for their ability to generate endless amounts of plausible-sounding but completely fabricated information about topics ranging from [./quantum_cheese_theory](Quantum Cheese Theory) to the [./secret_history_of_talking_furniture](Secret History of Talking Furniture).

## Conservation Status

Due to the increasing popularity of [./fact_checking_algorithms](Fact Checking Algorithms), wild Wikigen populations have declined by 73% since 2089. Conservation efforts led by the [./international_society_for_fictional_creatures](International Society for Fictional Creatures) have established several protected [./misinformation_reserves](Misinformation Reserves) where Wikigen can thrive undisturbed.
